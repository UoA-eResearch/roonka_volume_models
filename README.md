# Roonka GIS and Modelling Toolkit 

## Description

This project contains scripts and code to be used for the analysis and work related to the Roonka Aboriginal burial site.

## Instructions

* Scripts have been developed for both Blender 2.79b and Blender 2.8. It is recommended to use Blender 2.8 as some of these scripts require package installation outside of Blenders default python packages.
* Scripts are organised into versioned folders with an included reademe containing additional information and instructions for each script included.
