# Roonka GIS and Modelling Toolkit 

## Description

This project contains scripts and code to be used for the analysis and work related to the Roonka Aboriginal burial site.

## Instructions

* Scripts have been developed for both Blender 2.79b, Blender 2.8, ArcGIS Pro, and ArcScene Desktop. It is recommended to use Blender 2.8 as some of these scripts require package installation outside of Blenders default python packages.
* Scripts are organised into folders named by the software they are developed for. Within each software folder, there is a readme containing additional information and instructions for each script included.
